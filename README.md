### Overview
* Create a webpage that manages a home movie collection.

* Users should be able to see a list of all movies.
* Users should be able to update a movie.
* Users should be able to search for a movie by title
### Libraries
* This SPA was created with Reactjs
### Dependencies
* React Router  
  *  I used react router to maintain a single page application while giving the user to perception of switching pages
* Material-UI
  * Used for Icons and to style the text inputs
* LESS
  * I used LESS to structure and minimize my css.
### Comments
  * I used the Local Storage API to persist the data throughout my application
  * I did not use lodash.js or underscore.js because I felt that ES6 already handled all the methods that I needed.
